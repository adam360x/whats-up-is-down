# TODO

WE NEED TO MAKE AN ITERATION 1 BRANCH AND PUT THE FINAL APK ON IT, you'll need to git add insertnamehere.apk -f to force it, since apks are on the gitignore

WE ALSO NEED TO CONVERT THIS FILE INTO A PDF, possibly add a few pictures/screenshots in the PDF version to be submitted on canvas?

# Installation Instructions

Hello!  Welcome to What's Up Is Down!

For the iteration 1 update, we're compiling the .apk file for you to simply download to your device and run natively.

You have one of two options for this:

1. Load it natively onto your respective device.
  
  To do this, one needs to go onto their andriod security settings and find where it says, "Unknown Sources, Allow installation of apps from unknown sources" and toggle that    setting on.  Once this is completed, locate your andriod's "file manager".  Most androids simply have a file manager app.  Once this is located, either download the apk from the website via an internet browser and into a folder that you can find later, or download it on a pc and transfer it into a folder.  After the apk is successfully on your device and in a locatable folder, simply open it like any other app to run the game!
  

2. Use an android emulator. 

  To do this, one needs to download one of the many free android emualators.  We recommend LDPlayer.  Once this is installed via normal default settings, download the apk onto your host machine.  Find the file, and drag it onto the virtual android desktop.  Click to launch, and enjoy!
